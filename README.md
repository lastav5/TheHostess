<p style="font-size:16px">Work In Progress</p>  
<p>
Can view the app <a href="http://thehostess.herokuapp.com" onclick="window.open(this.href,'win','toolbars=0, width=400,height=711,left=200,top=30,status=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1');">here</a>.  

Some features don't fully work yet and some need to be updated and caught up to the latest changes in code. 
Change the date in the date bar, click on a table to view the reservations assigned to it and serach for any reservation data in the search box.  
Tables can have multiple reservations and reservations can have multiple tables. For each table and reservation there is a single object in memory to which all other references to this table or reservation point. This results in all data being synchronized automatically.
